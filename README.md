# WIDS-2024-Introduction to Machine Learning in Data Science

This Winter in Data Science Project under the Analytics Club, IIT Bombay is being mentored by [Paneendra](https://github.com/DPaneendranadha) and me

## Contents
- Week-1 : Basics of Python and required libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas
- Week-2 : Implementing Gradient Descent, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and other related concepts
- Week-3 : Implementing Artificial Neural Networks
- Week-4 : Implementing and using CNNs
- Week-5 : Final Project (problem statement not decided though!)

Resources and assignments will be uploaded to the corresponding week's folders

## Project Policies
- To be honest, this project will not be on the first page of 2nd-year resume, and not at all in the 3rd-year resume, so there is no point in doing this for just filling your resume
- This Project will serve as a foundation for most of ML projects you will be doing later, hence put efforts in learning the concepts rather than the implementation itself
- Throughout the course of this project you will be learning lots of things through reading, watching videos or through assignments, so in case of any doubt try to google and find answer yourself. This is an essential skill required for an IITB student (which you must have already accepted or will accept very soon)
- We strictly encourage you not to use ChatGPT or any other AI tool, use Google and other resources like Documentation, Geeks for Geeks, w3schools, Stack Overflow etc, as they tell you not only your doubt but also lots of different things in that concept
- Still if you weren't able to figure out yourself, feel free to reach out to any of us
- Every week there will be compulsory assignments and optional assignments, try to complete compulsory assignments and if time permits, you can try optional ones (you can always ask for more questions if you have completed these)
- We will be manually checking your solutions for some questions, so smart and unique solutions will be rewarded ( please don't ChatGPT here; the reward will, of course not outweigh the losses you incur because of using AI now)
- Again, I am emphasizing that the aim of the project is learning the concepts rather than completing the assignments or the final project
