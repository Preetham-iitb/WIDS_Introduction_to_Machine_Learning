## Python Resources
- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp ; this is a pretty good resource for python
  - All sub-sections in the Python Tutorial section except inheritance, iterators, Polymorphism, Dates, JSON, and regex; I expect you to go thoroughly through these sections
  - All sub-sections in File Handling, go through this thoroughly.
  - Go through string, list, tuple, dictionary, set methods in the Python Reference section; you don't need to remember all these, so make sure to understand what can be done using these; you can always refer here for the exact function
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh ; this is also a decent video, but this doesn't cover everything but is good enough for the simple stuff

You can start with the first resource, but if you don't feel confident then you may watch the video in the 2nd resource first, you can skip the 2nd resource if you feel confident after studying the first resource </br>
This is not an exhaustive set of resources, you will definitely need to look over other concepts/resources (ChatGPT is not a resource btw!) when solving the assignments  

## Python Libraries Resources
Here you only need to remember a few basics in Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas. For most of the syntax and functions, you will need to refer to the documentation or just Google it
- Numpy - https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_intro.asp; go through the Numpy Tutorial section
- Pandas - https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_intro.asp; go through Pandas Tutorial, Cleaning Data, Correlations sections
- Matplotlib- https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_intro.asp; go through Python Matplotlib section, here don't spend much time just go through the stuff and make sure you can plot simple line plots, scatterplots, bars, and histograms

## Work Plan
- You may spend 2-3 days on python, 1-2 days on Python Libraries
- Spend more time on solving the assignments, you will be learning many things while solving only
- Since this is the first week, I am expecting decent involvement in the project, and hence you may feel this week be slightly hectic but this is completely fine
- I made the Python assignments tougher than the Libraries assignment, because you will mostly be needing the libraries concepts only in the coming weeks, but learning core python concepts is also important, so you may try the python libraries assignment first
- At the end of the week, we will be floating a feedback form, you can give feedback on the resources, assignments or pace of the course
