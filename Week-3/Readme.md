## Neural Networks
Last week, we focused on predicting data using regression models. This week, weâ€™ll explore a new approach: Neural Networks. Inspired by the human brain, neural networks consist of interconnected layers that process and learn from data. There are 3 types of neural networks :
- **Artificial Neural Networks(ANN):**
    The simplest type, where data flows in one direction from input to output.
    Eg:  Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN):**
    Specialized for processing grid-like data such as images, with layers that detect patterns like edges and textures.
    Eg: Identifying objects in images, such as distinguishing cats from dogs in photos.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN):**
    Designed for sequential data like time series or text, with the ability to retain memory of past inputs.
    Eg: Predicting stock prices based on historical trends or generating text in chatbots.

This week we will focus on ANN's. The labs for each respective week are listed below, with instructions on how to execute them at the end .

- [Week 1](/C2%20-%20Advanced%20Learning%20Algorithms/week1)

### How to run the labs:
- Clone (pull) the entire resources of this week using the command 'git clone https://github.com/dheerajkumar2005/WIDS_Introduction_to_Machine_Learning'.
- If you want to open for example some lab in week1. Go to week1 folder.
- **For VSCode users:** open the optional Labs in week1 folder in VS code and run the notebook as usual.
- **For Colab/Jupyter Notebook:** Use should upload the entire folder Optional Labs(In this example Optional labs in week1).And then you can run the notebook.
- The **entire folder** is required as labs have some files imported in them which are present in the folder itself.
