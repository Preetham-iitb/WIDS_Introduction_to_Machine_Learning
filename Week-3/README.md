## Resources
- This week you will be learning about simple neural networks with dense layers
- This and the next week you will mostly be following a coursera course https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms?specialization=machine-learning-introduction
- First two weeks of the course need to be completed by end of this week
- You will get the videos in this course for free, we will provide you the labs which you can run in your local system
- Videos are kind of slow, so you can watch them at 1.5-2x speed
## Steps to access the videos
- First click on the link https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms?specialization=machine-learning-introduction
- Then you will see enroll for free option click on it.
- When a window appears showing the subscription options, scroll to the bottom and select the "Audit the Course" option.
- By auditing the course, you will gain free access to the videos.
## What we expect from you
- Watch all videos of the course
- Run the labs provided and understand and appreciate how the code / specific algorithm like gradient descent works
- It is better if you can write the optional labs code on your own after understanding the code
- The assignment will be shared soon, but it will be based on the labs you have done
- For now start with the resouces provided, we will be providing more resources in the coming days
- If you have any doubts, you can ask in the group or DM the mentors

## Neural Networks
Last week, we focused on predicting data using regression models. This week, weâ€™ll explore a new approach: Neural Networks. Inspired by the human brain, neural networks consist of interconnected layers that process and learn from data. Many different types of architecture have been developed to solve various ranges of problems. 

This week, we will be studying simple neural networks with dense layers. 

- [Week 1](/C2%20-%20Advanced%20Learning%20Algorithms/week1)

   - [Neurons and Layers]
   - [Coffee Roasting]
   - [Coffee Roasting Using Numpy]

- [Week 2](/C2%20-%20Advanced%20Learning%20Algorithms/week2)
  
    - [Relu]
    - [Softmax]
    - [Multiclass Classification]

### How to run the labs:
- Clone (pull) the entire resources of this week using the command 'git clone https://github.com/dheerajkumar2005/WIDS_Introduction_to_Machine_Learning'.
- If you want to open for example some lab in week1. Go to week1 folder.
- **For VSCode users:** open the optional Labs in week1 folder in VS code and run the notebook as usual.
- **For Colab/Jupyter Notebook:** Use should upload the entire folder Optional Labs(In this example Optional labs in week1).And then you can run the notebook.
- The **entire folder** is required as labs have some files imported in them which are present in the folder itself.
