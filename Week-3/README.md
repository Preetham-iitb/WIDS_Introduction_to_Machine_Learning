## Neural Networks
Last week, we focused on predicting data using regression models. This week, weâ€™ll explore a new approach: Neural Networks. Inspired by the human brain, neural networks consist of interconnected layers that process and learn from data. Many different types of architecture have been developed to solve various ranges of problems. 

This week, we will be studying simple neural networks with dense layers.

### How to run the labs:
- Clone (pull) the entire resources of this week using the command 'git clone https://github.com/dheerajkumar2005/WIDS_Introduction_to_Machine_Learning'.
- If you want to open for example some lab in week1. Go to week1 folder.
- **For VSCode users:** open the optional Labs in week1 folder in VS code and run the notebook as usual.
- **For Colab/Jupyter Notebook:** Use should upload the entire folder Optional Labs(In this example Optional labs in week1).And then you can run the notebook.
- The **entire folder** is required as labs have some files imported in them which are present in the folder itself.
