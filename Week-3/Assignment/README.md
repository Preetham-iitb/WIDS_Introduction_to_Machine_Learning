## New York Air Quality 

The goal of this assignment is to preprocess the dataset(which we have covered in week-1) and build an optimal Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for prediction.
The data is in the csv file.

---



### Objective
The goal is to build an ANN model that predicts air quality metrics using the dataset provided. The performance of the model will be evaluated using metrics like **Accuracy**
---

## Tasks

### 1. Data Splitting
- Separate the dataset into **train**, **validation**, and **test** sets.
  - Use an appropriate ratio, e.g., 70% train, 15% validation, and 15% test.
  - Ensure the splitting process is random and avoids data leakage.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Convert all features into **numerical format**:
  - Handle categorical data using encoding techniques like **One-Hot Encoding** or **Label Encoding**.
  
- Handle missing or invalid values in the dataset.

### 3. Model Building
- Create a **Simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** model using TensorFlow.
- Optimize the model architecture:
  - Experiment with the number of layers and neurons.
  - Use **activation functions** like ReLU or Sigmoid.
  

### 4. Evaluation
- Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using:
  - **Accuracy i.e %correctly classified**


### 5. Optimization
- Iterate and improve the model to improve the accuracy
- Report the final performance metrics.


### Implement the code in .ipynb file and submit it
