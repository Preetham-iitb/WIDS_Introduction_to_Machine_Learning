## **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**  

This week, we will dive into **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**â€”a powerful and widely used deep learning technique for image classification and processing. CNNs are a cornerstone of computer vision and have a wide range of applications in various domains.  

### **Learning Resources**  

   - Begin from the **19th video** in this https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZbbT5o_s2xq7LwI2y8_QtvuXZedL6tQU&feature=shared. It provides detailed explanations and examples to help you understand CNNs step by step.  


   - If you would like to follow the lectures from the **same professor**, refer to this https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Gl29AoE31iwdVwSG-KnDzF&feature=shared. It includes other relevant content from the previous week and beyond.  


   - To gain a more intuitive understanding, explore this httgit ps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1sQgSTcAaT7MbcLWacjsqoOQvqzMdUWg&feature=shared, which offers excellent visualizations of CNN concepts and operations.  


Focus on understanding the building blocks of CNNs, such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, and feature maps. These concepts will form the foundation for more advanced topics.
