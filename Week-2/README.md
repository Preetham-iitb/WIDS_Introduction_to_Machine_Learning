## Resources
- This week you will be learning about linear and  logistic regression, along with optimization techniques like gradient descent.
- This and the next week you will mostly be following a coursera course https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/ 
- All 3 weeks of the course need to be completed by end of this week
- You will get the videos in this course for free, we will provide you the labs which you can run in your local system
- Videos are kind of slow, so you can watch them at 1.5-2x speed
## Steps to access the videos
- First click on the link https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/
- Then you will see enroll for free option click on it.
- When a window appears showing the subscription options, scroll to the bottom and select the "Audit the Course" option.
- By auditing the course, you will gain free access to the videos.
## What we expect from you
- Watch all videos of the course
- Run the labs provided and understand and appreciate how the code / specific algorithm like gradient descent works
- It is better if you can write the optional labs code on your own after understanding the code
- See the optional labs on scikit learn after you complete all other labs
- The assignment will be shared soon, but it will be based on the labs you have done
- For now start with the resouces provided, we will be providing more resources in the coming days
- If you have any doubts, you can ask in the group or DM the mentors
## Getting started with Machine Learning
After completion of week-1 , we learned basics needed for ML i.e. Python and its Libraries. In this week we will start Machine learning.

### **Supervised Learning**

A type of machine learning where the model is trained using labeled data, i.e., each input data point is paired with a corresponding output label.

- **Labeled Data:** Input data comes with labels or outcomes.
- **Goal:** Learn the mapping function from inputs to outputs so the model can predict the label of new, unseen data.
- **Feedback:** The model is guided by the error between predicted and actual outputs.


### Types
1. **Regression**
2. **Classification**

### **Unsupervised Learning**


A type of machine learning where the model is trained using unlabeled data, i.e., there are no explicit outcomes or labels provided.

- **Unlabeled Data:** The model identifies patterns or structures in the data.
- **Goal:** Group or cluster similar data points or reduce data dimensionality for better analysis.
- **Feedback:** No direct feedback; relies on inherent structures in data.

### Types
1. **Clustering**
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**

In this course, we will focus solely on **Supervised learning** .

To begin, we will cover a fundamental technique in Supervised learning within machine learning: regression. Regression can be categorized into two types based on the type of data to be predicted:

- **Linear Regression** (for numerical data)
- **Logistic Regression** (for categorical data)
  
Watch all the videos on the Regression Model provided in the Coursera course shared in the Resources section. 
For enhanced understanding, optional labs are included in the course. While you may not have direct access to these labs through Coursera, they are shared in this repository [link]. The labs for each respective week are listed below, with  instructions on how to execute them at the end .

### How to run the labs:
- Clone (pull) the entire resources of this week using the command 'git clone https://github.com/dheerajkumar2005/WIDS_Introduction_to_Machine_Learning'.
- If you want to open for example some lab in week1. Go to week1 folder.
- **For VSCode users:** open the optional Labs in week1 folder in VS code and run the notebook as usual.
- **For Colab/Jupyter Notebook:** Use should upload the entire folder Optional Labs(In this example Optional labs in week1).And then you can run the notebook.
- The **entire folder** is required as labs have some files imported in them which are present in the folder itself.
### Note :
In the labs there will be some code used for visualisation just focus on the required code.
